# csgo-skins-scraper-from-different-markets-2021-project
Collects csgo skins price from different websites such as "market.csgo.com", "dmarket.com" and "steamcommunity.com/market/". Also program can show collected data on web applcation interface, where costumer can compare different website's skin prices.

Currently this project is not functioning properly cause some of the code is outdated. Some websites have changed, but i think that there is still some segments of code which may be usable for other users.

Database: postgresql 12.13 version
